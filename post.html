	<h1>#page-2: post</h1>
	<p>I want to implement a functionality wherein on clicking the back button, i come back to the same position. A good example may be http://www.jabong.com/men/clothing/mens-t-shirts/ . Here, if you scroll down and hit on a product, and click back from the product page, you reach the same position of the page where that product is.

The example shown here doesn't append anything in the url to remember the position. Also, it doesn't use pushstate or history.js (not loading through ajax).

Any insights into how I can do this?

EDIT: Im using infinite scrolling pagination (like pinterest), and the pages keep loading on scrolling down. When I go back, the query runs again and reloads the page. If I was on the 4th page before, after going back, the pages don't load until page 4 and so there's a break, thus I cant reach that position.

So my question is how do I do this with infinite scrolling?</p>
